This mini-project intended to discover convolutional filters that are
emphasize some patterns over other in 1d signals.

For example I would like to know which convolutions emphasizes such
patterns as slope, hill, pit, S and etc.

For this purposes I will create a simple dataset, which contains these
types of patterns under different labels and train CNN to find best
convolutions and then investigate them.
